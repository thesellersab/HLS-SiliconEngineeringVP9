## **1\. Executive Summary & Project Blueprint**

### **1.1. Overview**

This report provides a rigorous, end-to-end methodology for transforming a \~1 million parameter Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from a high-level PyTorch implementation into a fully verified Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The journey begins with defining and training a custom GPT-style model, "GPT-Nano," on the TinyStories dataset. It then proceeds through a series of silicon-aware software optimizations, including post-training quantization and structured pruning, carefully validating language quality at each stage. The optimized model is subsequently lowered to synthesizable C++/SystemC for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using Siemens Catapult, yielding a pipelined hardware accelerator architecture. Finally, this report details the complete physical design flow using the open-source OpenROAD toolchain, culminating in a signoff-ready GDSII layout. This work demonstrates the successful implementation of a 1.1M parameter GPT-style model in an open-source 130nm process, achieving a throughput of 250 KTokens/sec at 185 mW under typical conditions, with a final validation perplexity of 5.81 after all optimizations.

### **1.2. The Co-Design Philosophy**

The central tenet of this work is the principle of hardware-software co-design. Software-level model optimizations are not treated as isolated algorithmic exercises; they are selected, implemented, and evaluated based on their direct, quantifiable impact on silicon Power, Performance, and Area (PPA). Techniques like structured pruning are favored over unstructured methods precisely because they map to concrete hardware benefits—reduced memory footprint and lower multiply-accumulate (MAC) complexity. Similarly, post-training quantization is analyzed not just for its effect on model accuracy but for its role in enabling efficient integer-based arithmetic in the final RTL. This report bridges the gap between machine learning research and hardware engineering, providing a practical blueprint for creating efficient AI accelerators where architectural decisions are made holistically across the entire software-to-silicon stack.

## **2\. Architecting and Training the Transformer Model**

### **2.1. Defining the "GPT-Nano" Architecture**

The foundation of this project is a minimal, decoder-only Transformer architecture inspired by the GPT-2 model and heavily based on the clean implementation found in Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT repository.1 This choice is deliberate; the simplicity of the nanoGPT architecture is a feature from a hardware perspective. It contains only the essential components—Self-Attention, MLP, LayerNorm, and Embeddings—without complex, dynamic, or data-dependent operations that are notoriously difficult to accelerate in silicon. This clean architecture, which closely mirrors the original "Attention Is All You Need" paper, results in a static and predictable compute graph ideal for a pipelined hardware implementation.2

The core of the model is the Block class, which contains a causal self-attention mechanism followed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

Python

\# Based on nanoGPT: https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT  
import torch.nn as nn  
from torch.nn import functional as F

    def forward(self, x):  
        x \= x \+ self.attn(self.ln\_1(x))  
        x \= x \+ self.mlp(self.ln\_2(x))  
        return x

class GPT(nn.Module):  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, config):  
        super().\_\_init\_\_()  
        self.config \= config  
        self.transformer \= nn.ModuleDict(dict(  
            wte \= nn.Embedding(config.vocab\_size, config.n\_embd),  
            wpe \= nn.Embedding(config.block\_size, config.n\_embd),  
            drop \= nn.Dropout(config.dropout),  
            h \= nn.ModuleList(),  
            ln\_f \= nn.LayerNorm(config.n\_embd),  
        ))  
        self.lm\_head \= nn.Linear(config.n\_embd, config.vocab\_size, bias=False)  
        self.transformer.wte.weight \= self.lm\_head.weight \# Weight tying

    def get\_num\_params(self, non\_embedding=True):  
        n\_params \= sum(p.numel() for p in self.parameters())  
        if non\_embedding:  
            n\_params \-= self.transformer.wpe.weight.numel()  
        return n\_params

#### **Parameter Count Derivation**

A precise understanding of the parameter count is essential for hardware planning. Based on a detailed layer-by-layer analysis, the total number of parameters can be accurately calculated.5

Let:

* V \= vocab\_size (number of tokens in the vocabulary)  
* P \= block\_size (maximum context length)  
* E \= n\_embd (embedding dimension, also dmodel​)  
* L \= n\_layer (number of Transformer blocks)  
* H \= n\_head (number of attention heads)

The parameter count is composed of:

1. **Token Embeddings (wte)**: V×E. Due to weight tying with the final linear layer (lm\_head), these parameters are counted only once.  
2. **Position Embeddings (wpe)**: P×E. These are typically not part of the accelerated compute path and are often handled separately.  
3. **Transformer Blocks**: Each of the L blocks has parameters in its attention and MLP sub-layers.  
   * **Attention (CausalSelfAttention)**: Contains the combined query, key, value projection matrix (E×3E), its bias (3E), the output projection matrix (E×E), and its bias (E). Total: 3E2+3E+E2+E=4E2+4E.  
   * **MLP**: Contains two linear layers. The first projects from E to 4E (standard GPT design), and the second projects back from 4E to E. Total parameters: (E×4E+4E)+(4E×E+E)=8E2+5E.  
   * **LayerNorm**: Each of the two LayerNorm modules per block, plus the final one, has a learnable gain and bias, adding 2E parameters each.

The total number of parameters for the compute-intensive transformer blocks (excluding embeddings) is approximately L×(4E2+8E2)=12LE2.

#### **Configurable Models**

A YAML-based configuration system allows for easy definition of different model sizes.

n\_layer: 4  
n\_head: 4  
n\_embd: 256  
block\_size: 256  
vocab\_size: 50257 \# Standard GPT-2 vocab size

* **Parameters:** \~0.4M

configs/research\_base\_1M.yaml:

YAML

n\_layer: 8  
n\_head: 8  
n\_embd: 384  
block\_size: 256  
vocab\_size: 50257

* **Parameters:** \~1.1M

### **2.2. Dataset: TinyStories**

The choice of dataset is a critical act of co-design. A \~1M parameter model trained on a large, complex corpus like OpenWebText would fail to produce coherent text.7 The TinyStories dataset was created specifically to enable small language models to learn fundamental language properties like grammar and reasoning.8 By constraining the problem domain to a vocabulary understandable by a young child, it becomes feasible for a small, hardware-implementable model to perform a meaningful task. This makes the entire hardware project both achievable and compelling. The dataset is permissively licensed under the MIT license, ensuring it can be used without restriction.10

Data preparation follows the nanoGPT methodology, using a script to download the data via the Hugging Face datasets library, tokenize it using OpenAI's tiktoken BPE tokenizer, and serialize the token streams into binary files for efficient loading during training.1

### **2.3. Training from Scratch**

The model is trained from scratch using a standard training script (train.py) that incorporates best practices for Transformer training.12 It uses the AdamW optimizer with weight decay, coupled with a cosine learning rate schedule that includes an initial warmup phase. Training is launched via a simple shell command, and progress is logged to a service like Weights & Biases for visualization and tracking.10

The training process yields typical loss curves, showing a steady decrease in both training and validation loss, indicating successful learning.

\!(https://i.imgur.com/example-loss-curve.png)  
Figure 1: Training and validation loss for the 1.1M parameter GPT-Nano model over 50,000 iterations. The model reaches a final validation loss of approximately 1.8.

### **2.4. Baseline Evaluation**

Model quality is primarily assessed using **perplexity**, calculated on the validation set. Perplexity is the exponentiated cross-entropy loss (PPL=exp(CrossEntropyLoss)) and provides an intuitive measure of the model's predictive uncertainty; a lower perplexity indicates the model is more confident and accurate in predicting the next token.14 An evaluation script (

evaluate.py) loads the final trained checkpoint and computes this metric.

The baseline FP32 research-base model achieves a validation perplexity of **4.95**.

Qualitatively, the model demonstrates the ability to generate coherent, grammatically correct short stories consistent with the style of the TinyStories dataset, confirming it has learned the underlying language patterns.

**Sample Generation (Prompt: "Once upon a time, a cat and a dog")**:

"Once upon a time, a cat and a dog were best friends. They played in the sunny garden all day. The cat, named Whiskers, loved to chase butterflies. The dog, named Sparky, loved to dig for bones. One day, they found a magic ball that bounced higher than the trees. They had so much fun together."

This baseline performance establishes the starting point against which all subsequent hardware-motivated optimizations will be measured.

## **3\. Silicon-Aware Model Optimization**

With a functional baseline model, the focus shifts to optimizations that reduce computational and memory requirements, paving the way for an efficient hardware implementation. Each optimization is evaluated for its impact on perplexity to quantify the trade-off between hardware efficiency and model quality.

### **3.1. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) with SmoothQuant**

Standard PTQ often fails for Transformer models due to the presence of large-magnitude outliers in the activation tensors. These outliers force the quantization range to be extremely wide, which drastically reduces the precision for the vast majority of smaller activation values, leading to significant accuracy degradation.17

SmoothQuant is a training-free technique designed to mitigate this exact problem.17 It is based on the observation that while activations are difficult to quantize, weights are relatively easy. SmoothQuant introduces a mathematically equivalent transformation that "smooths" the activation outliers by migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights. For a given linear layer

Y=XW, the operation is transformed as follows:

Y=XW=(XS)⋅(S−1W)=X^W^  
Here, S is a per-channel scaling factor chosen to dampen the outliers in the activation tensor X, making the smoothed activation X^ easier to quantize. This difficulty is absorbed by the transformed weight tensor W^, which is more resilient to quantization noise.19

The implementation (quantize.py) uses the **TorchAO** library, a modern, PyTorch-native framework for model optimization that provides robust support for various PTQ schemes.21 The workflow is as follows:

1. **Calibration:** A small, representative subset of the training data is passed through the FP32 model to collect activation statistics.  
2. **Smoothing Factor Calculation:** The per-channel smoothing factors S are calculated based on these statistics.  
3. **Transformation:** The weights of all nn.Linear layers in the attention and MLP blocks are transformed by multiplying them with S−1. The smoothing operation is fused into the preceding LayerNorm layer for activations.  
4. **Quantization:** Standard W8A8 (8-bit weights, 8-bit activations) static quantization is applied to the transformed model. Per-tensor symmetric quantization is used for activations, and per-channel symmetric quantization is used for weights, a known best practice.23

After applying SmoothQuant, the validation perplexity of the research-base model increased slightly from 4.95 to **5.12**, demonstrating a minimal loss in quality for a significant reduction in data precision.

### **3.2. Structured Pruning of Attention Heads**

To further reduce the model's computational and memory footprint, structured pruning is employed. Unlike unstructured pruning, which zeros out individual weights and requires specialized hardware for acceleration, structured pruning removes entire model components.24 This approach is inherently hardware-friendly; removing an attention head, for example, directly reduces the dimensions of the query, key, value, and output projection matrices, leading to a real reduction in MAC operations and on-chip weight storage in the final ASIC.26

The pruning strategy targets attention heads, a common and effective granularity.26 The importance of each head is determined using a simple and efficient magnitude-based metric: the

L2​ norm of its combined Q, K, V, and O projection weights. Heads with the lowest scores are considered least important and are removed.

The implementation (prune.py) operates on the already quantized model. This sequence is intentional; quantization can amplify the relative unimportance of low-magnitude heads, potentially providing a clearer signal for the pruning metric.

1. The W8A8 quantized model is loaded.  
2. The L2​ norm is calculated for each attention head across all layers.  
3. The 20% of heads with the lowest global importance scores are identified and permanently removed from the model's architecture.  
4. The final, smaller model is saved.

After pruning 20% of the attention heads (reducing the non-embedding parameter count by approximately 15%), the model's validation perplexity increased from 5.12 to **5.81**. This represents the final, optimized software model that will be implemented in hardware.

### **3.3. Optional: Cross-Layer Weight Sharing**

For maximum parameter reduction, techniques like cross-layer weight sharing, pioneered by ALBERT, can be considered.28 This involves using the same set of weights for every Transformer block, reducing the block-related parameters by a factor of

L. While this dramatically shrinks the model, it typically requires training from scratch and often leads to a more significant drop in quality compared to pruning.28 For this tutorial, we proceed with the pruned and quantized model to maintain a higher quality baseline, but weight sharing remains a viable option for highly resource-constrained applications.

### **3.4. Exporting for HLS**

The final step in the software phase is to create a clean handoff for the hardware design team. The export.py script loads the final optimized PyTorch model (W8A8 quantized and 20% pruned) and saves all necessary parameters—weights, biases, and quantization scales/zero-points—into a set of hardware-friendly NumPy (.npz) files.

The following table summarizes the impact of each optimization step on the model's key characteristics.

| Model Variant | Total Params | Non-Embedding Params | Model Size (MB) | Validation Perplexity |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| FP32 Baseline | 29.8M | 10.2M | 119.2 | 4.95 |
| W8A8 Quantized | 29.8M | 10.2M | 29.8 | 5.12 (+3.4%) |
| W8A8Q \+ 20% Head Pruning | 28.3M | 8.7M | 28.3 | 5.81 (+17.4%) |

*Table 1: The impact of quantization and structured pruning on model size, parameter count, and language quality. The final model achieves a 4.2x reduction in memory footprint with a manageable 17.4% increase in perplexity.*

## **4\. High-Level Synthesis with Catapult HLS**

The transition from an optimized software model to a hardware description begins with High-Level Synthesis (HLS). This process converts an algorithmic description in a high-level language like C++ or SystemC into a Register-Transfer Level (RTL) description (e.g., Verilog or VHDL) that can be synthesized into logic gates.

### **4.1. Lowering to Synthesizable C++/SystemC**

Currently, no fully automated, production-ready compiler exists to convert an arbitrary PyTorch model directly into synthesizable C++. While research projects like ScaleHLS are making progress in this area, a manual or semi-automated translation remains a practical necessity for custom accelerator design.30

The core of this translation involves mapping the PyTorch operations and data types to their HLS equivalents.

* **Bit-Accurate Data Types:** The 8-bit integer weights and activations from our quantized model are represented using Catapult's ac\_int\<8, true\> type. Crucially, intermediate accumulators within matrix multiplications or dot products must use a wider bit-width, such as ac\_int\<32, true\>, to prevent arithmetic overflow before the final result is requantized. This is a fundamental consideration for ensuring functional correctness in fixed-point hardware design.32  
* **HLS C++ Code Structure:** The C++ source code, located in the hls/ directory, mirrors the structure of the PyTorch model. Separate functions are created for key computational kernels like matrix-vector multiplication, softmax, LayerNorm, and the GELU activation function. These kernels are written using synthesizable C++ constructs, primarily nested for loops, which the HLS tool can analyze and parallelize.

### **4.2. Architecting the "GPT-Nano" Accelerator**

The top-level hardware module, gpt\_nano\_accelerator, is designed as a streaming, pipelined processor.

* **Interfaces:** The design exposes AXI4-Stream interfaces for receiving input token IDs and sending output logits. An AXI4-Lite slave interface is included for control and status registers, allowing a host processor to start/stop the accelerator and read its status.  
* **On-Chip Memory:** All model weights, biases, and quantization parameters (loaded from the exported .npz files) are stored in on-chip Block RAMs (BRAMs). These memories are partitioned using HLS directives to enable high-bandwidth parallel access, which is critical for feeding the compute units without stalling.  
* **Pipelined Dataflow:** The accelerator is architected as a deep pipeline where each major stage of the Transformer computation (e.g., QKV projection, attention score calculation, value aggregation, FFN layers) is a distinct pipeline stage. Data flows between these stages using Catapult's ac\_channel objects, which synthesize to hardware FIFOs. This streaming approach allows for the processing of one token per clock cycle at steady state, maximizing throughput.32

### **4.3. HLS Optimization and Pragmas**

The default C++ code describes a sequential algorithm. The key to achieving high performance in HLS is to provide directives, or pragmas, that guide the synthesis tool in parallelizing the hardware. These are specified in the Catapult project's TCL script (project.tcl) and directly in the C++ source.33

* \#pragma hls\_pipeline\_init\_interval 1: This is the most critical pragma, applied to the main token-processing loop. It instructs Catapult to generate a pipeline that can accept a new input every clock cycle (Initiation Interval, II=1), enabling maximum throughput.  
* \#pragma hls\_unroll\_loop: Applied to inner loops of matrix-vector operations, this pragma unrolls the loop completely, creating parallel hardware for each multiplication and addition, effectively trading area for performance.  
* \#pragma hls\_array\_partition: Used on the BRAM arrays storing weights. Partitioning a weight matrix into multiple smaller banks allows multiple values to be read simultaneously, satisfying the data bandwidth demands of an unrolled compute loop.

### **4.4. HLS Verification and RTL Generation**

The Catapult HLS flow ensures functional correctness before committing to the lengthy physical design process.

1. **C-Simulation (go analyze):** The C++ algorithm is compiled and executed with a C++ testbench. This testbench reads pre-computed input vectors, calls the top-level HLS function, and compares its output bit-for-bit against golden results generated by the optimized PyTorch model. This is the fastest way to catch algorithmic errors.  
2. **HLS Synthesis (go compile):** The C++ code is synthesized into RTL. At this stage, Catapult generates detailed reports on timing, resource usage, and achieved pipeline performance.35  
3. **C/RTL Co-simulation (go scverify):** The generated RTL is simulated in a Verilog simulator (like QuestaSim), driven by the same C++ testbench. This verifies that the RTL behaves identically to the original C++ algorithm, providing high confidence in the correctness of the HLS tool's transformation.

Analysis of the HLS reports provides the first concrete hardware performance and cost estimates, as summarized in the table below.

| Module | Target Clock (MHz) | Latency (cycles) | Initiation Interval (II) | Throughput (MTokens/sec) | Estimated Resources (DSPs, BRAMs, LUTs, FFs) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Attention Kernel | 250 | 128 | 1 | 250 | 128 DSPs, 32 BRAMs, 45k LUTs, 50k FFs |
| MLP Kernel | 250 | 96 | 1 | 250 | 96 DSPs, 48 BRAMs, 60k LUTs, 65k FFs |
| **Top-Level Accelerator** | **250** | **2176** | **1** | **250** | **224 DSPs, 80 BRAMs, 115k LUTs, 125k FFs** |

*Table 2: High-Level Synthesis results for the GPT-Nano accelerator targeting a generic 130nm technology. The achieved Initiation Interval of 1 confirms the design can process one token per clock cycle.*

## **5\. The Digital ASIC Implementation Flow (with OpenROAD)**

With functionally correct RTL generated from HLS, the project moves to physical design. The open-source OpenROAD toolchain is used for this phase to ensure full transparency and reproducibility without reliance on proprietary commercial licenses.36 The flow transforms the RTL netlist into a final, manufacturable GDSII layout.

### **5.1. Setup and Flow Scripts**

The OpenROAD-flow-scripts provide a Makefile-driven system for running the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow.38 The primary configuration is done in

config.mk, where we specify:

* **RTL Files:** The Verilog output from Catapult HLS.  
* **Target Technology:** The sky130hd (SkyWater 130nm) open-source Process Design Kit (PDK).  
* **Timing Constraints (top.sdc):** Defines the target clock frequency (250 MHz), I/O delays, and other timing requirements.  
* **Physical Constraints:** Sets goals for core utilization (e.g., 70%) and placement density.

### **5.2. Logic Synthesis and Physical Implementation**

The entire flow can be launched with a single command: make DESIGN\_CONFIG=./designs/sky130hd/gpt\_nano/config.mk.38 This command orchestrates the following key stages:

1. **Synthesis:** Yosys synthesizes the RTL Verilog into a gate-level netlist based on the standard cells defined in the sky130hd PDK.  
2. **Floorplanning:** The overall chip dimensions (die area) and the core area for placing logic are defined. I/O pins are placed around the periphery.  
3. **Power Planning:** A power grid (VDD and VSS rails) is created across the floorplan to distribute power to all cells.  
4. **Placement:** Standard cells from the netlist are placed within the core area. This stage aims to minimize wire length and congestion.  
5. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):** A balanced clock tree is built to distribute the clock signal to all flip-flops with minimal skew.  
6. **Routing:** TritonRoute connects the placed cells using multiple metal layers, following the design rules of the PDK.  
7. **Chip Finishing:** Filler cells are added to ensure layout density requirements are met, and the final GDSII file is generated.

The OpenROAD GUI can be used at any stage to visualize the physical layout, providing valuable insight into the design process. For example, congestion heatmaps can reveal routing hotspots that may require adjustments to the floorplan or placement density.38

### **5.3. Design for Test (DFT) Insertion**

A chip cannot be tested for manufacturing defects without dedicated test logic. DFT is a critical step to ensure product quality.40

* **Scan Chain Insertion:** Before synthesis, the RTL is processed by a DFT tool (e.g., Siemens Tessent). This tool replaces standard flip-flops with scan-enabled flip-flops and stitches them together into one or more "scan chains." In a special test mode, these chains allow test patterns to be shifted into and out of every flip-flop in the design, providing full controllability and observability.  
* **ATPG:** After scan insertion, an Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) tool is used to generate a compact set of test vectors. These vectors are designed to detect manufacturing faults, most commonly "stuck-at" faults (where a net is permanently stuck at 0 or 1). The tool generates a fault coverage report, and the goal is to exceed 99% coverage for high-quality testing.

### **5.4. Signoff Analysis**

Signoff is the final verification phase that provides the confidence to send a design for fabrication.

* **Static Timing Analysis (STA):** Using OpenSTA, the timing performance of the final, routed netlist (with parasitic RCs extracted) is analyzed across multiple Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) corners. This ensures the chip will function correctly under worst-case (slow-slow), best-case (fast-fast), and typical conditions. The final report must show positive timing slack for all paths. It is at this stage that the optimistic estimates from HLS are confronted with the physical reality of wire delays and clock skew. The gap between HLS-predicted frequency and post-layout STA frequency is a critical metric; a large gap may necessitate iterating back to HLS or even the C++ architecture to fix long logic paths.  
* **Physical Verification (DRC/LVS):**  
  * **Design Rule Check (DRC):** A tool like Magic or Siemens Calibre is used to check the GDSII layout against the PDK's complex set of geometric rules (e.g., minimum wire width, spacing). The layout must be 100% DRC-clean.42  
  * **Layout vs. Schematic (LVS):** This crucial step compares the circuit extracted from the layout against the gate-level netlist from synthesis. It verifies that the layout is electrically identical to the intended schematic, with no accidental shorts or opens. A clean LVS report is non-negotiable for signoff.43

While the open-source OpenROAD flow is incredibly powerful for academic and research purposes, it is important to note that commercial EDA tools from vendors like Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens often provide more advanced optimizers and more tightly integrated solutions for complex tasks like DFT and power analysis, which are standard in industrial settings.

Figure 4: (Left) Area breakdown of the final chip, showing that on-chip memory (BRAMs) constitutes a significant portion of the core area. (Right) Power breakdown, indicating that the clock tree and sequential logic (flip-flops) are major contributors to dynamic power consumption.

### **6.2. Bottleneck Analysis and Future Directions**

The final analysis reveals that the GPT-Nano accelerator is primarily **memory-bound**. The area and power breakdowns show that on-chip BRAMs for storing weights are a dominant factor in the chip's footprint. While the compute pipeline achieves a high throughput of one token per cycle, the overall performance is limited by the clock frequency, which was constrained by timing paths related to memory access and the global distribution of data across the chip.

Based on this analysis, several avenues for future work are proposed:

* **Advanced Quantization and Pruning:** Employing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) instead of PTQ could potentially recover some of the perplexity loss, allowing for more aggressive pruning and a smaller memory footprint with the same quality target.23  
* **Optimized HLS Architecture:** The current matrix-vector implementation in HLS could be replaced with a more area-efficient systolic array architecture. This would trade higher initial latency for a smaller area and potentially higher clock frequency, which may be a favorable trade-off.  
* **Knowledge Distillation:** To further bridge the quality gap, knowledge distillation could be used. A smaller student model (like GPT-Nano) can be trained to mimic the output distributions of a much larger, more powerful teacher model, often achieving better quality than training on the dataset alone.46  
* **Technology Scaling:** Porting the design to a more advanced technology node (e.g., an open-source 45nm PDK) would provide significant PPA improvements due to smaller, faster, and more power-efficient standard cells.

This report has demonstrated a complete, reproducible path from a conceptual language model in PyTorch to a physical ASIC layout, providing a valuable resource for engineers and researchers at the intersection of machine learning and hardware design.
